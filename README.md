# CSharpLab

> A personal playground for learning and experimenting with C# concepts through practical examples.  
> Publicly available for anyone who wants to follow along or use the examples.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

CSharpLab is a **personal project** designed to help the author **learn and explore C# features and best practices**.  
It provides **small, focused demos** that illustrate **specific language features, patterns, or structures**, accompanied by **explanations, benefits, and potential pitfalls**.

Although this is a personal study project, it is **public** so anyone can **follow along, learn, or reuse the code**.

Currently, the repository focuses on **C# constructors**, but it is designed to expand over time to include **other concepts, patterns, and structures**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals

This project is intended to grow over time. Planned additions include:

- **Demos for additional C# language features**  
  Explore structs, properties, events, pattern matching, LINQ, and more.

- **Design patterns and best practices**  
  Show real-world examples of patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

- **Performance tips and common pitfalls**  
  Highlight potential issues and teach how to write efficient and safe C# code.

- **Expanded explanations**  
  Each demo will include reasoning, benefits, drawbacks, and usage recommendations.

- **Learning reference for developers**  
  Make the repository a comprehensive resource for developers at all levels.

## ðŸ§  Notes

- Written for **C# 12 / .NET 8**, leveraging **modern language features** such as primary constructors in classes.  
- Each demo includes **explanations, benefits, and drawbacks**, helping understand **why and when to use each feature**.  
- This is a **personal study project**, but it is **publicly available** for anyone who wants to follow along or reuse the examples.  
- The structure of the project is modular, so new demos or concepts can be added **without affecting existing examples**.  
- Examples are **self-contained**, so you can run them individually or as part of the full demo sequence.
